Console commands can be sent in 2 ways:
Client-side: Using the console on your client. You cannot use it by default. To enable it, in keyboard options click advanced and enable the developer console. Default key is ` (~). If a command is client-sided, that doesn't mean it won't do anything on the server
Server-side: Using the console from your dedicated server. You can only use it using rcon

The "toggleconsole" can be binded to add another key to open the console
